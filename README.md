# Game Scheduler

This is an app that is designed for generating a schedule.

## How to use?

Simply enter a name for your scheme, a date range and define some time-columns
for your groups (like youth, seniors or all the different teams of your club)
and the app will generate a timescheme for each week inside the given date
range.

These timeschemes are flexible because you can edit each week apart or even
add/remove a day to your week.
